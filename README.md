## CitesCyverse

#### Interactive data visualizations to show usage and influence of iPlant Collaborative/CyVerse 

This "CitesCyVerse" site was built and based off of work done by SCKE: [The Science Citation Knowledge Extractor](https://github.com/hclent/Science-Citation-Knowledge-Extractor). It is an open source tool that helps biomedical researchers understand how their work is being used by others, by analyzing the content in papers that cite them. This tool uses natural language processing and machine learning to extract the prominent themes and concepts discussed in the citing documents. By seeing what kinds of topics are discussed by citing articles, researchers can better understand how their work influences their peers and various disciplines in science. CitesCyVerse only has certain features of SCKE, so we recommend that you also checkout SCKE!
